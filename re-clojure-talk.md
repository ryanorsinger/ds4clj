# A Data Scientist Coming to Clojure, An Experience Report

## What?

## So What?

## Who?

## Now What?

Tailwinds for Clojure:
- Java installation is fast and direct
- Clojure installation is fast and direct
- Beginner friendly community, especially SciCloj

Headwinds:
- Overall, there's an analysis paralysis new users face due to the plethora of options
- editor selection is overwhelming without a guide
- deps.edn vs. leiningen
- 3 sessions of setup and 5 hours total to go from clojure install to averaging a numeric column from a dataframe using the Tablecloth library. Time challenges came from connecting an interactive REPL to the project, downloading and importing the library, and sorting out named vs. anonymous functions



Concepts newbies have to learn
- namespaces



- `install.packages("tidyverse")` then `library(tidyverse)` is both simple and easy.


Would be nice to have
- Tidyverse of recommended packages
- "lein new data" template for data analytics project template
